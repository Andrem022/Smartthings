# Note: We have to do a `redirect_to` here rather than a redirect_from
# in the file for the latest spec version, as the latter causes jekyll 
# generate a redirect to `/format/{version}/index.html`, which is an ugly
# and non-canonical url, and jekyll's url config settings aren't flexible
# enough to prevent this. 
redirect_to: /format/1.1/
